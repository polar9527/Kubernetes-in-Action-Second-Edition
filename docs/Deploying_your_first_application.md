# 3. Deploying your first application

This chapter covers
* Running a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your laptop
* Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine
* Setting up and using the kubectl command-line tool
* Deploying an application in Kubernetes and making it available across the globe
* Horizontally scaling the application

The goal of this chapter is to show you how to run a local single-node development Kubernetes cluster or set up a proper, managed multi-node cluster in the cloud. Once your cluster is running, youâ€™ll use it to run the container you created in the previous chapter.
